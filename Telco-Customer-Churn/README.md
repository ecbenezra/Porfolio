# Telco Churn Project

Using a [popular datset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) about Telco customer churn, I explored the data and trained several machine learning models to predict if a customer would or would not churn. I focused on a high-recall model. After training my models and evaluting them, I move through several suggestions of further research and market segmentation to work from a business perspective.

I also allow for the data to be used in mutliple ways -- such as if a company wanted not to reduce churn, but reduce overhead by not offering customers who did not plan to leave incentives to stay, therefore saving money. This would result in the company wanting a 'high precision' model, instead of the high recall model to catch customers who were churning.
